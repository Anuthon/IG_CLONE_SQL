 Project Title: Instagram-like Database with SQL Queries

In this project, I designed and implemented an Instagram-like relational database using SQL. The database consists of multiple interconnected tables to simulate key features of the platform. These tables include:

Users: Stores information like usernames, user IDs, and registration dates.

Photos: Contains details of photos uploaded by users, including photo IDs, image URLs, and associated user IDs.

Likes: Tracks user likes on specific photos by linking user IDs and photo IDs.

Comments: Records comments left on photos, along with user IDs, comment text, and timestamps.

Hashtags: Manages hashtags associated with various photos to facilitate tagging and categorization.

After setting up the database, I performed several queries to extract useful insights, such as:

Identifying the most liked photos.

Analyzing the frequency of photo uploads per user.

Counting and ranking the most popular hashtags.

Displaying user comments along with associated photos.

This project provided hands-on experience with SQL operations like joins, aggregations, sorting, and grouping, simulating real-world database usage for social media platforms.
